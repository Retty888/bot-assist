# GitHub Repository Naming Proposal

To host the automated Hyperliquid trading bot, consider naming the repository `hyperliquid-signal-bot`. The name highlights all essential characteristics:

- `hyperliquid` clarifies the exchange integration target.
- `signal` emphasizes that the bot reacts to structured trade signals.
- `bot` states that the project provides automation.

This concise naming keeps the repository easy to discover and understand when published on GitHub.
